## **API Rate Limiting**

You can make a maximum of **100 REQUESTS PER 15 MINUTE WINDOW**. If you exceed the request limit, the API will respond with `429 Too many requests, please try again later`. If you need to process large sets of XRPL addresses we advise you to use the `POST /verify-bulk` endpoint. If you only need to verify a single XRPL address you should use the `GET /verify` endpoint.

Each request will return the following headers:

- `RateLimit-Limit` - This value will always show `100`. The value is related to the max number of requests you can make within the 15 minute window.

- `RateLimit-Remaining` - How many requests remaining until you have hit the rate limit. 

- `RateLimit-Reset` - The number of seconds remaining in the current 15 minute window before the rate limit is reset.
